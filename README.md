# Q_and_A_chat_bot
The code source of this bot is taken from the professor J. Restituyo GitHub account, the main idea is to refactor and adapt it to a ITLA Q&amp;A bot. This is part of the series of final practices.

#### Requirements / Business rules: Starting from the source code of the chatbot, modify it with the following,

- (1) Make the chatbot to answer questions about the ITLA. 
- (2) It must have at least 10 questions and variants (different ways of asking the same thing) and their answers.
- (3) The questions and answers must be all in a separate file (it can be a python code file) but apart from the core of the chatbot.
